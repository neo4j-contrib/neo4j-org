        <li>Improvements to diagnostic logging and to the reliability of embedded APIs during instance fail-over (Neo4j enterprise in HA configuration).</li>
        <li>Improvements to the database recovery process to avoid some scenarios that could cause the recovery after an unclean shutdown to fail.</li>
        <li>Correction of an isolation issue that could cause the failure of some traversals in the presence of concurrent write transactions.</li>
        <li>Allowing for a greater number of relationship types to be created within a single database. Neo4j now supports 65536 different relationship types.</li>
        <li>Improved store locking to prevent concurrent access of the store by multiple processes.</li>
        <li>Neo4j server will now use X-Forwarded-Host and X-Forwarded-Proto headers, if present, when generating the URIs contained in responses from the REST API.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>It is recommended to upgrade all Neo4j 1.8.1 (and earlier) installations to this release, which is fully backward compatible</strong>. Please see the <a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.8.2/deployment.html">deployment section of the neo4j manual</a> for more detail.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Correction of several concurrency issues affecting performance in multi-threaded configurations.</li>
        <li>Correction of several concurrency issues that infrequently affect consistency of persisted data.</li>
        <li>Optimization of high-availability (HA) protocols to increase write performance.</li>
        <li>Support for zero-downtime rolling upgrades in HA clusters.</li>
        <li>Improvements to transaction distribution in HA clusters, providing greater resistance to branching.</li>
        <li>Configurable rotation of logical logs.</li>
        <li>Support for streamed responses to REST API requests.</li>
        <li>Support for bi-directional traversals, branch state and path expanders in the traversal framework.</li>
        <li>Performance improvements to several graph algorithms.</li>
        <li>Support in the Cypher language for writing graph data and updating auto-indexes (manual indexes are not
            supported).
        </li>
        <li>Extensions to the Cypher language to allow the use of patterns as expressions and predicates.</li>
        <li>Correction of several issues in the Cypher parser when using collections and when aggregating.</li>

        <li>Support for explicit transactions in neo4j-shell.</li>
    </ul>
