    <h3 id="neo4j-1.9">Neo4j 1.9.1</h3>
    <p>The 1.9.1 release of Neo4j is a maintenance release that brings more safety
    features into high-availability cluster deployments, general bug fixes and a small
    number of API enhancements.</p>

    <p>In particular this release addresses:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Fixed race condition that could have lead to duplication in the getSingleRelationship()
          in the Core API.</li>
        <li>Reduces churn in the resource pool for channels and memory in a clustered environment.</li>
        <li>Individual pages in <a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/rest-api-traverse.html#rest-api-creating-a-paged-traverser">paged traversals</a>
          through the <a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/rest-api.html">REST API</a> can now be streamed like the other parts of the REST API, see <a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/rest-api-streaming.html">the RESTstreaming docs</a>.</li>
        <li>SSL certificate chains are supported by the Neo4j server for secure interactions with the
          <a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/rest-api.html">REST API</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>All 1.9 users are strongly recommended to upgrade to this version.</strong> Neo4j 1.9.1 does
    not require any store-level upgrades.</p>

    <h3 id="neo4j-1.9">Neo4j 1.9</h3>

    <p>The 1.9 release of Neo4j builds upon the previous 1.8 releases and
      brings extensive improvements in stability and performance. In addition,
      <i>Neo4j 1.9 Enterprise</i> introduces auto-clustering support,
      with dramatically simplified configuration and deployment for high demand
      production use.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Support for <a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/ha.html">auto-clustering in
        <i>Neo4j Enterprise</i></a>, which replaces the previous Zookeeper
        based HA clustering, provides a streamlined deployment process and is
        much safer and more resilient in failure scenarios.</li>
      <li>New <a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/arbiter-instances.html">neo4j-arbiter</a>
        tool, which acts as a voting instance in a Neo4j cluster but does not
        keep a data store or handle transactions.</li>
      <li>Addition of <a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/query-function.html">
        string manipulation, timestamp and other functions</a> to the Cypher query language.</li>
      <li>Improvements to memory utilization, which reduces working memory requirements and
        improves overall performance.</li>
      <li>New <a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/ha-rest-info.html">REST endpoints for
        inspecting cluster status information</a> (master, slave, etc).</li>
      <li>Correction of several concurrency and performance issues.</li>
      <li>Improvements to <a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/operations-backup.html">
        Online Backup</a> in <i>Neo4j Enterprise</i>, including auto-detection of
        full vs incremental backup based on existing content at the backup location.</li>
      <li>Updates to Neo4j server webadmin, including welcome pages for new users.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>It is recommended to upgrade all previous Neo4j installations to
      this release.</strong> Neo4j 1.9 does not require any explicit upgrade to
      persistent stores created using Neo4j 1.7 and 1.8 installations, however
      <i>current users of Neo4j Enterprise must consult the documentation and
      update the cluster configuration</i>. Please see the
      <a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/deployment.html">deployment</a>
      and <a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/upgrade-guide.html">cluster
      upgrade</a> sections of the neo4j manual for more detail. Also note that
      Neo4j 1.9 is tested and supported with
      <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Oracle
      JRE 7</a>. <i>Users of previous Java versions should upgrade to
      <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Oracle
      JRE 7</a> when deploying Neo4j 1.9.</i></p>

    <p>As part of the Neo4j 1.9 release, multiple behaviours and features of Neo4j have been
      declared as deprecated, in order to help users prepare for the removal of
      these in the next major Neo4j release. A <a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/deprecations.html">
      list of deprecations</a> can be found in the Neo4j manual.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Ensure auto-indexes correctly expunge deleted nodes and relationsips.</li>
