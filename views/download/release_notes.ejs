<h1>Neo4j Release Notes</h1>

<h3 id="1.9.5">Neo4j 1.9.5 (2013-11-11)</h3>

<p>This release addresses a number of bugs affecting HA cluster stability. 
    Everyone is advised to upgrade their 1.9.x Neo4j instances to this release.</p>
<h4>HA</h4>
<ul>

    <li>Removed all usage of getHostName() that might lead to problems on
        instances with improperly configured DNS
    </li>
    <li>The master instance will now always send out masterIsAvailable
        messages in response to masterIsElected, ensuring that instances
        in PENDING state will transition eventually to SLAVE
    </li>
    <li>Master instance now properly blocks transactions from starting
        after shutdown has started and waits on a timeout for running
        transactions to finish and be pushed to slaves before
        stopping completely
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Kernel</h4>
<ul>

    <li>Fixed NPE in PersistenceWindowPool when concurrently loading non-
        mapped windows
    </li>
    <li>Fixed potential deadlock in PersistenceWindowPool cause by negative
        mark count
    </li>
    <li>Performance optimizations for best-first selector</li>
    <li>Database now waits on a timeout for transactions to finish before
        actually shutting down, while preventing new transactions from
        starting up
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Server</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Shutdown hook is now properly removed on normal shutdown, removing
        potential thread leak which might prevent orderly exit of the VM
        process
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Graph Algorithms</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Fixed potential suboptimal path finding in A* executions for
        particular graph topologies. Also improved performance and memory
        consumption of A*
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Cluster</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug around channel handling which might lead to messages
        being delayed and leading to false heartbeat failures
    </li>

    <li>It is now possible to specify 0.0.0.0 for ha.cluster_server and
        properly wait for messages on all interfaces
    </li>
    <li>Removed all usage of getHostName() that might lead to problems on

        instances with improperly configured DNS
    </li>
    <li>Fixed election bug which might lead to infinite wait on elections
    </li>
    <li>Fixed election bug which might lead to votes being discarded and
        result in the wrong master being elected
    </li>
    <li>Instances no longer expect heartbeats from themselves so they can't
        timeout on their own
    </li>
    <li>Instances will now ignore suspicions from ex cluster members
    </li>
    <li>Instances will now ignore suspicions for themselves
    </li>
</ul>

        much safer and more resilient in failure scenarios.
    </li>
    <li>New <a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/arbiter-instances.html">neo4j-arbiter</a>
        tool, which acts as a voting instance in a Neo4j cluster but does not
        keep a data store or handle transactions.
    </li>
    <li>Addition of <a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/query-function.html">
        string manipulation, timestamp and other functions</a> to the Cypher query language.

    <li>Updates to Neo4j server webadmin, including welcome pages for new users.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>It is recommended to upgrade all previous Neo4j installations to
    this release.</strong> Neo4j 1.9 does not require any explicit upgrade to
    persistent stores created using Neo4j 1.7 and 1.8 installations, however
    <i>current users of Neo4j Enterprise must consult the documentation and
        update the cluster configuration</i>. Please see the
    <a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/deployment.html">deployment</a>
