        <li>Improvements to diagnostic logging and to the reliability of embedded APIs during instance fail-over (Neo4j enterprise in HA configuration).</li>
        <li>Improvements to the database recovery process to avoid some scenarios that could cause the recovery after an unclean shutdown to fail.</li>
        <li>Correction of an isolation issue that could cause the failure of some traversals in the presence of concurrent write transactions.</li>

        <li>Improved store locking to prevent concurrent access of the store by multiple processes.</li>
        <li>Neo4j server will now use X-Forwarded-Host and X-Forwarded-Proto headers, if present, when generating the URIs contained in responses from the REST API.</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Correction of several concurrency issues that infrequently affect consistency of persisted data.</li>
        <li>Optimization of high-availability (HA) protocols to increase write performance.</li>
        <li>Support for zero-downtime rolling upgrades in HA clusters.</li>
        <li>Improvements to transaction distribution in HA clusters, providing greater resistance to branching.</li>

        <li>Support for bi-directional traversals, branch state and path expanders in the traversal framework.</li>
        <li>Performance improvements to several graph algorithms.</li>
        <li>Support in the Cypher language for writing graph data and updating auto-indexes (manual indexes are not
            supported).
        </li>
